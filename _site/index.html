        </h2>
	<p>I’m not certain if this is something anyone needs often, but at least I was surprised to learn this can also be done from the command line. So I needed to overlay something on a map as a marker, and already had fired up Gimp and started to edit a shadow file to be used in JavaScript. Little I knew that ImageMagick was able to do that as well!</p>

        </h2>
	<p>This topic may not be immediately relevant, but can still be interesting for somebody. So the question is: How to generate sound files with R, which just play sine wave at one specific frequency. One immediate reason is to test the frequencies you are yourself able to hear. I’m now lost somewhere after 17250 hz, which sounds horrendously low, but maybe should not be so unusual for someone in my age (soon 29).</p>

        </h2>
	<p>I think quite a lot has been written about the data management workflows in documentary linguistics. Lots of this is about the whole workflow from field to the archive. I want to document here the workflow I’ve personally found very good for the immediate work on the field, and also desire to use later. This doesn’t even touch the issues of annotating, archiving, publishing or disseminating. <strong>I want to stress that this all is something that in my opinion should be done already at the field. Period. Don’t delay it, the consequences are heavy.</strong></p>

        </h2>
	<p>Often when we digitalize some text collections we end up with text blocks in one language, and the translations on some other language in similar blocks. However, in our modern language collections the text is divided into utterances, which often more or less do match with sentences.</p>

<p>There is no automatic way to match the sentences, because there isn’t always exact correspondence at the sentence level. However, some ways to work with this data are more difficult than the others.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>Doing language documentation with a language like Komi is in many ways different from working with actually non-documented languages. With Komi there is a long research history and collection of data has been ongoing for about 170 years. The data varies and is uneven, but the new data collected now can only be observed and used in connection to the old. In no village can we ever be the first fieldworkers. This of course opens up the question of how many villages there are and where exactly they are located.</p>

	<p>We were recently writing a small abstract together with a few colleagues (Michael Rießler and Hanna Thiele). We started in Dropbox, but that is, as usually, quite bad in intensive writing. In principle we could use other tools we use already anyway, GitHub or SVN, but the same problem remains that it would be very convenient to see what others are editing and use some clear system for commenting.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>We are having a good recording session in the village of Krasnoye, Nenetskiy Avtonomnyj Okrug, Northern Russia, when we realise that our new good video camera is filling up the sd-card much faster than we anticipated. Everything on the card is backed up to several external hard drives, I have one copy at my laptop even - let’s make there some space. It is not so good practice to touch your SD-cards, they are so cheap that they never really should need to be reused, but this situation demanded radical solutions. I go and remove some of the backupped .MTS files - that is the actual video file, right?</p>

<p>Hell broke loose.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>It is very common that we have a large amount of files in one folder, and then for whatever reason we decide that we would need to create for each filename a unique folder, where the different files sharing same name but different endings could reside. I had recently lots of ELAN files which I wanted to move into their own directories. I believe this is a very common situation, so I wanted to share it.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>One of the problems in ELAN is that it doesn’t really give you a good picture from the wave form for the whole file. Often this is full of visual cues that help us to find relevant pieces, i.e. songs, where new section starts etc. Naturally for different purposes we need different views, and this means use of different programs which handle some aspect particularly well.</p>

        </h2>
	<p>While we document the endangered languages of the world there is quite a lot to do. Data quality, data content, connection with the speech communities, managing different audio and video files – this is in many ways extremely difficult job to do. One would assume that the technical solutions which we use would had been designed to make this work as easy as possible. Somehow this does not seem to be the case. Technology is just a tool, our real questions have nothing to do with it. This blog functions mainly as a platform where one can collect notes and tips about how to do different things.</p>
