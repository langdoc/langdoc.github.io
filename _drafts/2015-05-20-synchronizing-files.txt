# File synchronization

Hi! I've wanted to write something about this topic for a while, but
then it feels bit difficult to explain this in written form. So I've
prepared a screen cast with further comments. I think in language
documentation we still generally speaking work with the idea that we
have one recording per session, and that in principle this recording
is ready to be transcribed right after it has been done. In my opinion 
it has not received enough attention that between recording and
transcribing there is nowadays quite complicated post-production phace.

Audio and video are often discussed as if they were some kind of a
dichotomy. This signals that it is maybe poorly understood that video
as media is a combination of both audio and image. This means
that components of good video are good audio and good video. Video
with bad audio would be basically a bad video. So the relationship of
these two media is litle bit more complicated than is often
understood.
