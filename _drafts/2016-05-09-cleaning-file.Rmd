### Workflow

This is quite pain in the assy thing to do, but it is often
necessary. It is quite typical that one has to add a new file into
corpus. It may be something that in principle has nothing to do with
spoken language corpus, but on the other hand, it is not very
desiderable to have distinct models for working with relatively
similar data.

So what I've often done is to bring text based files into ELAN.

    pdftotext file.pdf
    cat sust258_tsypanov.txt | perl -pe 's/(\!|\?|;|:|\.) /$1\n/g' | perl -pe 's/([А-ЯӦа-яӧіьъ])\n/$1 /g'



We often have sections like:

> Перым кывъясöн сёрнитö куим матысса ордвуж войтыр:
  удмуртъяс,
  зыран-коми да перым-комияс.

Which have this structure because in the pdf there were line breaks in
these locations.
