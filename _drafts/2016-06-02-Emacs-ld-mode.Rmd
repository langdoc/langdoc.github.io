In the language documentation projects where I've been working the typical recorded texts usually last around 45 minutes. Usual setup is to record a conversation between several native speakers and a linguist, who is also semi-fluent speaker, about different topics about which one could believe there are some interesting narratives to share or which we for one reason or another assume people would be happy to talk about. Often this kind of working method records very large amounts of local history and personal biographies of different individuals. I'm very often the linguist who participates to the recording event, but I usually tend to fade myself to the background, and start to ask some questions of my own toward the end of the discussion. Usually my questions are very specific, for example, what is the relation of the speaker to other language consultants with who some other people have worked on different decades. In small communities these connections inevitably are there, but it is important to collect this information when possible.

However, as I try to fade myself to the background, I've been thinking why shouldn't I erase myself from the picture entirely. At least now it is inevitable that someone takes care from camera and audio recorder, fine, but what I need to do for the most of the time is to sit and take notes. I would very much prefer to do this with my computer, as I type much faster than I can write by hand. The text is also more legible this way, and most importantly, the text would be in the digital format right from the beginning. Actually, I would like to remove myself from the whole room if possible. Couldn't I just listen the recording from another room and do my notes there? I understand I can't type on my laptop in the space where the recording is taking place, as it would be inevitable that my typing would be audible on the recording. Besides this it would probably be quite bothering for everybody if someone just looks into computer while other are having their hands full of recording.

One would need quite specific tool to make notes the way I would like. It isn't only about making notes, it is also important that they would be time-aligned with the audio. I'm writing in some very specific point in time, which of course happens simultaneously with the recording session, so these time stamps should be easy to match, **if one just has them**.

I have started to set up a new mode in Emacs which would address most of my needs. Someone probably wonders why Emacs. Well, the good aspect is that it is so old that it probably is not going anywhere. Developing something for Emacs is pretty guaranteed to work for couple of decades to come, so instead of trying to build these functionalities into some trendy text editor of the day, it can be good strategy to settle into something very well tested. Minus side of course is that Emacs is that old. As it predates the invention of mouse it is very unintuitive to use, but I try to take that into account and explain carefully how this works.

Emacs is written mainly in programming language called Emacs Lisp. This means that modifying very basic behauviours in it demands just tiny changes to the underlying code. However, the changes have to be limited into the buffer where the particular mode, `ld-notes-mode`, happens to be active. So the functionality demanded from the mode is:

- Automatic file name which matches with the session name
- YAML-header where some rudimentary metadata can be added
- Every new line should be accompanied with a timestamp
- New time stamp should automatically append to the end of the file (for situations where you are editing metadata fields, for example)

The idea is that a file like this is trivially easy to convert into ELAN and CMDI. The best side is that thereby you have some ELAN file, CMDI file and audio file on your hands right when the session has ended. Now one can wonder: where did the audio file come from? Well, it has to come from somewhere, since you must be able to hear what is being said in another room. The best solution I've came up with is to have a long enough XLR cable and plug that into USB audio interface. I'm thinking about something like this:

I mean people in language documentation are quite attached to the portable Zooms and Edirols, but in fact I am almost always recording in places where electricity is rather basic thing. I understand this is very much a luxury from my side, but I also assume the electric cables are now being pulled to the most remote corners of the Earth, in similar fashion as modern telephone masts supporting online access also would be. But of course, as usually, I don't really know what I'm talking about, so I may be very wrong as well.
