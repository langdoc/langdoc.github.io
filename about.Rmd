This website is maintained by Niko Partanen and Michael Rie√üler. It will discuss topics related to language documentation projects funded by different groups and with work done in different universities, so it is not stricktly connected to any one project or institutions. The site has been built with `rmarkdown` package. The main reason to this is that it allows:

* Writing all content in simple RMarkdown files, which has many advantages
    + Can be read as-is
    + Easy to embed R code (or almost any other code)
    + Is easily rendered into other formats (PDF, Word, HTML)
    + Can be used as-is outside the website context 
* Allows access to bibliography
* Keeps the website structure extremely simple
* Pretty fast to compile
* Still looks good!
